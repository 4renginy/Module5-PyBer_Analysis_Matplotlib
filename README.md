# PyBer Analysis
## Project Purpose

Pyber is multi million dollar python based ride-sharing app company. The company wants us to do some explatory analysis on their data collections as csv files. We were given city_data and ride_data containing information cities, type of cities, dates, fares and drivers counts. Dates wil will run is between Jan 2019 and April 2019.Creating those visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer will help managment <br>
<br>
	*to absorb info more quickly,<br>
	*to detect patterns, trends, correlations and outliers<br>
	*to make sound decisions on project planning and drive business decisions.<br>
<br>
## Method and findings <br>

Using Jupyter Notebook with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries we wrote [PyBer Analysis Challange code](https://github.com/4renginy/Module5-PyBer_Analysis_Matplotlib/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)<br>
Grouping total rides, Drivers, Fares,Avg Fare per Ride, and Avg. Fare per driver by city type we were able to find following;<br>

1-Urban cities has 13 times more rides than Rural cities and 2.6 times than Suburban cities,<br>

2-Urban cities has 31 times more drivers than Rural Cities and 5 times more than Suburban cities,<br>

3-Urban cities bring 9 times more fares than Rural Cities and 2 times more than Suburban cities,<br>

4-Rural cities average fare costs 1.4 times more than Urban and 1.1 times more than Suburban cities,<br>

5-Rural city drivers makes 3.3 times more money than Urban drivers and 1.4 times more than Suburban cities.<br>

When we run the data between Jan 2019 - Apr 2019, line graph showed the findings on one chart alltogether.

## Conclusion
Looking at the results the company is doing a good job however the following suggestions might help to carry the company better postion;

	1-Graph shows at the beginning of Jan total fares are down in Urban and Suburban cities, a promotion for that
		period of time might raise the total fares
	2-Rural and suburban cites have significantly lower amount of drivers, some of the following items would help 
		to increase the driver count;
						
						a-running some promotions like signup bonuses
						b-providing smart phones and app usage support for the drivers
						c-helping potential drivers with car rental or lease

	3-Rural and suburban cities have significantly high fares than the urban cities, if we can lower the fares, 
		we would be more competative against our competators.
