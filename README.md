# PyBer Analysis
## Project Purpose

Pyber is multi million dollar python based ride-sharing app company. The company wants us to do some explatory analysis on their data collections as csv files.<br>

We were given city_data and ride_data containing information cities, type of cities, dates, fares and drivers counts. Dates wil will run is between Jan 2019 and April 2019<br>
Creating those visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer will help managment <br>
<br>
	*to absorb info more quickly,<br>
	*to detect patterns, trends, correlations and outliers<br>
	*to make sound decisions on project planning and drive business decisions.<br>
<br>
## Method and findings,br>

Using Jupyter Notebook with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries we wrote [PyBer Analysis Challange code](https://github.com/4renginy/Module5-PyBer_Analysis_Matplotlib/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)<br>
Grouping total rides, Drivers, Fares,Avg Fare per Ride, and Avg. Fare per driver by city type we were able to find following;<br>

Urban cities has 13 times more rides than Rural cities and 2.6 times than Suburban cities,<br>

Urban cities has 31 times more drivers than Rural Cities and 5 times more than Suburban cities,<br>

Urban cities bring 9 times more fares than Rural Cities and 2 times more than Suburban cities,<br>

Rural cities average fare costs 1.4 times more than Urban and 1.1 times more than Suburban cities,<br>

Rural city drivers makes 3.3 times more money than Urban drivers and 1.4 times more than Suburban cities.<br>

to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods by using Python graphing library Matplotlib.
