Data visiulation 
Pyber is multi million dollar python based ride-sharing app company. The company wants us to do some explatory analysis on their data collections as csv files. 

We were given city_data and ride_data containing information cities, type of cities, dates, fares and drivers counts. Dates wil will run is between Jan 2019 and April 2019. 
Creating those visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer will help managment 
	*to absorb info more quickly, 
	*to detect patterns, trends, correlations and outliers 
	*to make sound decisions on project planning and drive business decisions.


Using Jupyter Notebook with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries we wrote [PyBer Analysis Challange code](https://github.com/4renginy/Module5-PyBer_Analysis_Matplotlib/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)<br>
Grouping total rides, Drivers, Fares,Avg Fare per Ride, and Avg. Fare per driver by city type we were able to find following;<br>

Urban cities has 13 times more rides than Rural cities and 2.6 times than Suburban cities
Urban cities has 31 times more drivers than Rural Cities and 5 times more than Suburban cities
Urban cities bring 9 times more fares than Rural Cities and 2 times more than Suburban cities
Rural cities average fare costs 1.4 times more than Urban and 1.1 times more than Suburban cities
Rural city drivers makes 3.3 times more money than Urban drivers and 1.4 times more than Suburban cities.
